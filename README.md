# MergeThemAll

### so, here's what I did to practice some git branching ...
* added main.go in master branch
* added a function sum() in sumfunc branch
* added a function sub() in subfunc branch
* merged the changes in master branch
* locally deleted both sumfunc & subfunc branches
* remotely deleted both sumfunc & subfunc branches
